__label__Antony This Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
A prize worth: man safe;

Divide bosom.
__label__Cleopatra I sick sullen.
__label__Antony Not so, so;
I know lack, I certain on't,
Very necessity thought, I,

Could graceful eyes attend wars
Which fronted peace. As wife,

Begin suits anew, sue him.
[Tears supplication]
Away, base cullions! Suffolk, go.
__label__Antony Ay, Lepidus.
__label__Cleopatra He disposed mirth; sudden
A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
__label__Antony Tug away: whipp'd,
Bring again: Jack Caesar's shall
Bear errand him.
[Exeunt Attendants THYREUS]
You half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
Have I pillow left unpress'd Rome,
Forborne getting lawful race,
And gem women, abused
By looks feeders?
__label__Cleopatra No, I not:
All strange terrible events welcome,
But comforts despise; size sorrow,
Proportion'd cause, great
As makes it.
[Enter, below, DIOMEDES]
How now! dead?
__label__Antony Let loves strike dead.
__label__QueenMargaret Hear ye, captain, leisure?
__label__Antony This slight unmeritable man,

Pray God acquit suspicion!

Say I dancing; mirth, report
That I sudden sick: quick, return.
__label__QueenMargaret The stay, stronger grows foe.
__label__Antony Quarrel more, prepared know
The purposes I bear; are, cease,
As shall advice. By fire
That quickens Nilus' slime, I hence

__label__QueenMargaret For thousand Yorks shall hide head,
But boldly stand face.
__label__Cleopatra Where?
__label__Cleopatra Will eat me?
__label__Cleopatra Well, to, I will;
But there's goodness face: Antony
Be free healthful,--so tart favour
To trumpet good tidings! If well,
Thou shouldst come like Fury crown'd snakes,
Not like formal man.
__label__Antony I found morsel cold upon
Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, fragment
Of Cneius Pompey's; hotter hours,
Unregister'd vulgar fame, have
Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I sure,
Though guess temperance be,
You know is.
__label__Cleopatra Pray you, tell him
I fortune's vassal, I send him
The greatness got. I hourly learn
A doctrine obedience; gladly
Look i' face.
__label__Cleopatra Is Antony fault this?
__label__Cleopatra Wherefore this?
__label__Antony No,

The honour sacred talks now,
Supposing I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
The article oath.
__label__Antony O, quick, I gone.
__label__Cleopatra What, death too,
That rids dogs languish?
__label__QueenMargaret So poor chicken sure death.
__label__QueenMargaret Let humble thanks once.
__label__Cleopatra What, sad merry?
__label__Antony You shall find,
Though curious, cause
For fear: so, gods you,
And hearts Romans serve ends!
We part.
__label__Antony I reward thee
Once spritely comfort, ten-fold
For good valour. Come thee on.
__label__Antony Thou canst fear us, Pompey, sails;
We'll speak thee sea: land, know'st
How o'er-count thee.
__label__Cleopatra I like 'But yet,' allay
The good precedence; fie 'But yet'!
'But yet' gaoler bring forth
Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
Pour pack matter ear,
The good bad together: he's friends Caesar:
In state health say'st; say'st free.
__label__Cleopatra My desolation begin make
A better life. 'Tis paltry Caesar;
Not Fortune, he's Fortune's knave,
A minister will: great
To thing ends deeds;
Which shackles accidents bolts change;
Which sleeps, palates dug,
The beggar's nurse Caesar's.

To clear; confess I have
Been laden like frailties before
Have shamed sex.
__label__Antony My nightingale,
We beat beds. What, girl!
though grey
Do mingle younger brown, ha' we
A brain nourishes nerves, can
Get goal goal youth. Behold man;
Commend unto lips favouring hand:
Kiss it, warrior: hath fought to-day
As god, hate mankind, had
Destroy'd shape.

__label__QueenMargaret Can see? ye observe
The strangeness alter'd countenance?
With majesty bears himself,
How insolent late become,
How proud, peremptory, unlike himself?
We know time mild affable,
And glance far-off look,
Immediately knee,
That court admired submission:
But meet now, and, morn,
When time day,
He knits brow shows angry eye,
And passeth stiff unbowed knee,
Disdaining duty belongs.
Small curs regarded grin;
But great men tremble lion roars;
And Humphrey little man England.
First note near descent,
And fall, mount.
Me seemeth policy,
Respecting rancorous mind bears
And advantage following decease,
That come royal person
Or admitted highness' council.
By flattery hath won commons' hearts,
And commotion,
'Tis fear'd follow him.
Now 'tis spring, weeds shallow-rooted;
Suffer now, they'll o'ergrow garden
And choke herbs want husbandry.

Made collect dangers duke.

Which fear better reasons supplant,

Reprove allegation, can;
Or conclude words effectual.
__label__Antony Well, well;
We shall thrive now. Seest thou, good fellow?
Go defences.
__label__Antony Approach, there! Ah, kite! Now, gods

Authority melts me: late, I cried 'Ho!'
Like boys unto muss, kings start forth,
And cry 'Your will?' Have ears? I am

Take Jack, whip him.
__label__QueenMargaret Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.

His sons, says, shall words him.
__label__Antony Do so, we'll speak them; to-night I'll force
The wine peep scars. Come on, queen;
There's sap in't yet. The time I fight,
I'll death love me; I contend
Even pestilent scythe.
__label__QueenMargaret What sayst thou? Duke York was
rightful heir crown?
__label__QueenMargaret Off head, set York gates;
So York overlook town York.
__label__Antony Now, dearest queen,--

You know mantle: I remember
The time Caesar on;
'Twas summer's evening, tent,
That day overcame Nervii:
Look, place ran Cassius' dagger through:
See rent envious Casca made:
Through well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
And pluck'd cursed steel away,
Mark blood Caesar follow'd it,
As rushing doors, resolved
If Brutus unkindly knock'd, no;
For Brutus, know, Caesar's angel:
Judge, O gods, dearly Caesar loved him!
This unkindest cut all;
For noble Caesar saw stab,
Ingratitude, strong traitors' arms,
Quite vanquish'd him: burst mighty heart;
And, mantle muffling face,
Even base Pompey's statua,
Which ran blood, great Caesar fell.
O, fall there, countrymen!
Then I, you, fell down,
Whilst bloody treason flourish'd us.
O, weep; and, I perceive, feel
The dint pity: gracious drops.
Kind souls, what, weep behold
Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look here,
Here himself, marr'd, see, traitors.
__label__QueenMargaret Why, Henry king, Margaret queen;
And Humphrey Duke Gloucester scarce himself,
That bears shrewd maim; pulls once;
His lady banish'd, limb lopp'd off.
This staff honour raught, stand
Where best fits be, Henry's hand.
__label__Antony He deserved it, carbuncled
Like holy Phoebus' car. Give hand:
Through Alexandria jolly march;
Bear hack'd targets like men owe them:
Had great palace capacity
To camp host, sup together,
And drink carouses day's fate,
Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
With brazen din blast city's ear;
Make mingle rattling tabourines;
That heaven earth strike sounds together,
Applauding approach.
__label__Cleopatra Why, there's gold.
But, sirrah, mark, use
To dead well: bring that,
The gold I thee I melt pour
Down ill-uttering throat.
__label__QueenMargaret O princely Buckingham I'll kiss hand,
In sign league amity thee:
Now fair befal thee noble house!
Thy garments spotted blood,
Nor compass curse.
__label__Antony We well.
__label__QueenMargaret O, entreat thee cease. Give hand,
That I dew mournful tears;
Nor rain heaven wet place,
To wash away woful monuments.
O, kiss printed hand,
That mightst think seal,
Through thousand sighs breathed thee!
So, thee gone, I know grief;
'Tis surmised whiles art standing by,
As surfeits thinking want.
I repeal thee, or, assured,
Adventure banished myself:
And banished I am, thee.
Go; speak me; gone.
O, yet! Even friends condemn'd
Embrace kiss thousand leaves,
Loather times die.
Yet farewell; farewell life thee!
__label__Antony Why not?
__label__Antony But stirr'd Cleopatra.
Now, love Love soft hours,
Let's confound time conference harsh:
There's minute lives stretch
Without pleasure now. What sport tonight?
__label__Antony Then needs find new heaven, new earth.
__label__Cleopatra He god, knows
What right: honour yielded,
But conquer'd merely.
__label__Antony Tend to-night;
May period duty:
Haply shall more; if,
A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
You'll serve master. I look you
As takes leave. Mine honest friends,
I turn away; but, like master
Married good service, stay till death:
Tend to-night hours, I ask more,
And gods yield for't!
__label__Antony No light answers. Let officers
Have notice purpose. I shall break
The cause expedience queen,
And leave part. For alone
The death Fulvia, urgent touches,
Do strongly speak us; letters too
Of contriving friends Rome
Petition home: Sextus Pompeius
Hath given dare Caesar, commands
The empire sea: slippery people,
Whose love link'd deserver
Till deserts past, begin throw
Pompey Great dignities
Upon son; who, high power,
Higher blood life, stands up
For main soldier: quality, going on,
The sides o' world danger: breeding,
Which, like courser's hair, hath life,
And serpent's poison. Say, pleasure,
To place us, requires
Our quick remove hence.
__label__Cleopatra Caesar's will?
__label__QueenMargaret My Lord Suffolk, say, guise,
Is fashion court England?
Is government Britain's isle,
And royalty Albion's king?
What shall King Henry pupil still
Under surly Gloucester's governance?
Am I queen title style,
And subject duke?
I tell thee, Pole, city Tours
Thou ran'st tilt honour love
And stolest away ladies' hearts France,
I thought King Henry resembled thee
In courage, courtship proportion:
But mind bent holiness,
To number Ave-Maries beads;
His champions prophets apostles,
His weapons holy saws sacred writ,
His study tilt-yard, loves
Are brazen images canonized saints.
I college cardinals
Would choose pope, carry Rome,
And set triple crown head:
That state fit holiness.
__label__QueenMargaret Bear me; I hungry revenge,
And I cloy beholding it.
Thy Edward dead, stabb'd Edward:
Thy Edward dead, quit Edward;
Young York boot, they
Match high perfection loss:
Thy Clarence dead kill'd Edward;
And beholders tragic play,
The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
Untimely smother'd dusky graves.
Richard lives, hell's black intelligencer,
Only reserved factor, buy souls
And send thither: hand, hand,
Ensues piteous unpitied end:
Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
To suddenly convey'd away.
Cancel bond life, dear God, I prey,
That I live say, The dog dead!
__label__Antony Let Rome Tiber melt, wide arch
Of ranged empire fall! Here space.
Kingdoms clay: dungy earth alike
Feeds beast man: nobleness life
Is thus; mutual pair

And twain do't, I bind,
On pain punishment, world weet
We stand peerless.

May fly forth Egypt. Hast affections?
__label__Cleopatra What is't say?
__label__Cleopatra Thou hast forspoke wars,
And say'st fit.
__label__QueenMargaret Why, now, long-tongued Warwick! dare speak?
When I met Saint Alban's last,
Your legs better service hands.
__label__Antony I work in, friends: O, end

__label__Cleopatra As woman eunuch play'd
As woman. Come, you'll play me, sir?
__label__Antony Which entreated to, weigh

O, period curse!
__label__Antony If compose here, Parthia:
Hark, Ventidius.
__label__Cleopatra I know, eye, there's good news.
What says married woman? You go:
Would given leave come!
Let 'tis I here:

__label__Antony Dead.
__label__Cleopatra My salad days,
When I green judgment: cold blood,
To I said then! But, come, away;
Get ink paper:
He shall day greeting,
Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
__label__Cleopatra So Fulvia told me.
I prithee, turn aside weep her,
Then bid adieu me, tears
Belong Egypt: good now, play scene
Of excellent dissembling; look
Life perfect honour.
__label__Cleopatra Not know yet?
__label__Antony To fellow rewards
And 'God quit you!' familiar with
My playfellow, hand; kingly seal
And plighter high hearts! O, I were
Upon hill Basan, outroar
The horned herd! I savage cause;
And proclaim civilly, like
A halter'd neck hangman thank
For yare him.
[Re-enter Attendants THYREUS]

__label__Cleopatra I mind strike thee ere speak'st:
Yet Antony lives, well,
Or friends Caesar, captive him,
I'll set thee shower gold, hail
Rich pearls thee.
__label__QueenMargaret O Ned, sweet Ned! speak mother, boy!
Canst speak? O traitors! murderers!
They stabb'd Caesar shed blood all,
Did offend, worthy blame,
If foul deed equal it:
He man; this, respect, child:
And men ne'er spend fury child.
What's worse murderer, I it?
No, no, heart burst, I speak:
And I speak, heart burst.
Butchers villains! bloody cannibals!
How sweet plant untimely cropp'd!
You children, butchers! had,
The thought stirr'd remorse:
But chance child,
Look youth cut off
As, deathmen, rid sweet young prince!
__label__Antony No further, sir.

Best preserve it: I lose honour,

Shall stain brother: soonest haste;
So desires yours.

For I perceive I prisoner.
__label__Antony Come, let's hands,

In soft delicate Lethe.
__label__Antony Come, sir, come;

Look, I you; I go,

__label__Antony What's matter?
__label__Cleopatra That's brave lord!

Hie hence, tell so. Yet, stay awhile;

And meanest chares. It me

To tell world equal theirs
Till stol'n jewel. All's naught;
Patience scottish, impatience does
Become dog that's mad: sin
To rush secret house death,
Ere death dare come us? How you, women?
What, what! good cheer! Why, now, Charmian!
My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
Our lamp spent, it's out! Good sirs, heart:
We'll bury him; then, what's brave,

__label__Antony Fie, wrangling queen!

To itself, thee, fair admired!

Last night desire it: speak us.
[Exeunt MARK ANTONY CLEOPATRA with]

__label__Antony Belike notice people,

__label__QueenMargaret Those gracious words revive drooping thoughts
And tongue-tied sorrows leave speak.
Now, therefore, known noble Lewis,
That Henry, sole possessor love,
Is king banish'd man,
And forced live Scotland forlorn;
While proud ambitious Edward Duke York
Usurps regal title seat
Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
This cause I, poor Margaret,
With son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
Am come crave lawful aid;
And fail us, hope done:
Scotland hath help, help;
Our people peers misled,
Our treasures seized, soldiers flight,
And, seest, heavy plight.
__label__Antony Nay, nay, Octavia, that,--
That excusable, that, thousands more
Of semblable import,--but hath waged
New wars 'gainst Pompey; will, read it
To public ear:
Spoke scantly me: perforce not
But pay terms honour, cold sickly
He vented them; narrow measure lent me:
When best hint given him, took't,
Or teeth.
__label__Antony For Brutus' sake, I beholding you.
__label__Antony Will patient? stay awhile?
I o'ershot tell it:
I fear I wrong honourable men
Whose daggers stabb'd Caesar; I fear it.
__label__Antony The miserable change end
Lament sorrow at; thoughts
In feeding fortunes
Wherein I lived, greatest prince o' world,
The noblest; basely die,
Not cowardly helmet to

Valiantly vanquish'd. Now spirit going;

__label__QueenMargaret Hover her; say, right right
Hath dimm'd infant morn aged night.
__label__QueenMargaret I'll believe ascend sky,
And awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
O Buckingham, heed yonder dog!
Look, fawns, bites; bites,
His venom tooth rankle death:
Have him, beware him;
Sin, death, hell set marks him,
And ministers attend him.

__label__QueenMargaret Come, son, away; linger thus.
__label__QueenMargaret Ay, murder'd enemies.
__label__Antony Art there, Diomed? Draw sword, me
Sufficing strokes death.
__label__Antony I fled myself; instructed cowards
To run shoulders. Friends, gone;
I resolved course
Which need you; gone:
My treasure's harbour, it. O,
I follow'd I blush look upon:
My hairs mutiny; white
Reprove brown rashness, them
For fear doting. Friends, gone: shall
Have letters friends will
Sweep way you. Pray you, look sad,
Nor replies loathness: hint
Which despair proclaims; left
Which leaves itself: sea-side straightway:
I possess ship treasure.
Leave me, I pray, little: pray now:
Nay, so; for, indeed, I lost command,
Therefore I pray you: I'll by.

Then ring corpse Caesar,

__label__Antony O mighty Caesar! dost lie low?
Are conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
Shrunk little measure? Fare thee well.
I know not, gentlemen, intend,

As Caesar's death hour, instrument
Of half worth swords, rich

Give angle; we'll river: there,
My music playing far off, I betray
Tawny-finn'd fishes; bended hook shall pierce
Their slimy jaws; and, I draw up,

And 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'

__label__Antony Nay, good fellows, sharp fate
To grace sorrows: bid welcome
Which comes punish us, punish it
Seeming bear lightly. Take up:
I led oft: carry now, good friends,
And thanks all.
__label__Antony [To OCTAVIUS CAESAR] Thus they, sir: take
the flow o' Nile
By certain scales i' pyramid; know,
By height, lowness, mean, dearth
Or foison follow: higher Nilus swells,
The promises: ebbs, seedsman
Upon slime ooze scatters grain,
And shortly comes harvest.
__label__QueenMargaret King Lewis Lady Bona, hear speak,
Before answer Warwick. His demand
Springs Edward's well-meant honest love,
But deceit bred necessity;
For tyrants safely govern home,
Unless abroad purchase great alliance?
To prove tyrant reason suffice,
That Henry liveth still: dead,
Yet Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
Look, therefore, Lewis, league marriage
Thou draw danger dishonour;
For usurpers sway rule awhile,
Yet heavens just, time suppresseth wrongs.
__label__Cleopatra Is tall me?
__label__Antony To again: tell wears rose
Of youth him; world note
Something particular: coin, ships, legions,
May coward's; ministers prevail
Under service child soon
As i' command Caesar: I dare therefore
To lay gay comparisons apart,
And answer declined, sword sword,
Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
__label__Antony It shaped, sir, like itself; broad
as hath breadth: high is,
and moves organs: lives that
which nourisheth it; elements of
it, transmigrates.
__label__Antony Sit, sir.
__label__Antony Now, Eros.
__label__Antony Moreover, hath left walks,
His private arbours new-planted orchards,
On Tiber; hath left you,
And heirs ever, common pleasures,
To walk abroad, recreate yourselves.
Here Caesar! comes another?
__label__Cleopatra Well said.
__label__Antony Where he?
__label__Cleopatra Is married?
I hate thee worser I do,
If 'Yes.'
__label__Cleopatra Your Caesar's father oft,
When hath mused taking kingdoms in,
Bestow'd lips unworthy place,
As rain'd kisses.
__label__Antony Sometimes cloud that's dragonish;
A vapour like bear lion,
A tower'd citadel, pendent rock,
A forked mountain, blue promontory
With trees upon't, nod unto world,
And mock eyes air: hast seen
these signs;
They black vesper's pageants.
__label__QueenMargaret If old enough, needs grace
To protector excellence?
__label__Cleopatra As sweet balm, soft air, gentle,--
O Antony!--Nay, I thee too.
[Applying asp arm]
What I stay--
__label__Antony There's beggary love reckon'd.
__label__Cleopatra Noblest men, woo't die?
Hast care me? shall I abide
In dull world, absence is
No better sty? O, see, women,
[MARK ANTONY dies]
The crown o' earth doth melt. My lord!
O, wither'd garland war,
The soldier's pole fall'n: young boys girls
Are level men; odds gone,
And left remarkable
Beneath visiting moon.
__label__Cleopatra That time,--O times!--
I laugh'd patience; night
I laugh'd patience; morn,
Ere ninth hour, I drunk bed;
Then tires mantles him, whilst
I wore sword Philippan.
[Enter Messenger]
O, Italy
Ram fruitful tidings ears,
That long time barren.
__label__Cleopatra Though age folly freedom,
It childishness: Fulvia die?
__label__QueenMargaret Lords, knights, gentlemen, I say
My tears gainsay; word I speak,
Ye see, I drink water eyes.
Therefore, this: Henry, sovereign,
Is prisoner foe; state usurp'd,
His realm slaughter-house, subjects slain,
His statutes cancell'd treasure spent;
And yonder wolf makes spoil.
You fight justice: then, God's name, lords,
Be valiant signal fight.
__label__Cleopatra Is certain?
__label__Antony Too late, good Diomed: guard, I prithee.
__label__QueenMargaret Be woe me, wretched is.
What, dost turn away hide face?
I loathsome leper; look me.
What! art thou, like adder, waxen deaf?
Be poisonous kill forlorn queen.
Is comfort shut Gloucester's tomb?
Why, then, dame Margaret ne'er joy.
Erect statue worship it,
And image alehouse sign.
Was I nigh wreck'd sea
And twice awkward wind England's bank
Drove unto native clime?
What boded this, forewarning wind
Did 'Seek scorpion's nest,
Nor set footing unkind shore'?
What I then, cursed gentle gusts
And loosed forth brazen caves:
And bid blow England's blessed shore,
Or turn stern dreadful rock
Yet AEolus murderer,
But left hateful office unto thee:
The pretty-vaulting sea refused drown me,
Knowing wouldst drown'd shore,
With tears salt sea, unkindness:
The splitting rocks cower'd sinking sands
And dash ragged sides,
Because flinty heart, hard they,
Might palace perish Margaret.
As far I ken chalky cliffs,
When shore tempest beat back,
I stood hatches storm,
And dusky sky began rob
My earnest-gaping sight land's view,
I took costly jewel neck,
A heart was, bound diamonds,
And threw land: sea received it,
And I wish'd body heart:
And I lost fair England's view
And bid eyes packing heart
And call'd blind dusky spectacles,
For losing ken Albion's wished coast.
How I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
The agent foul inconstancy,
To sit witch me, Ascanius did
When madding Dido unfold
His father's acts commenced burning Troy!
Am I witch'd like her? false like him?
Ay me, I more! die, Margaret!
For Henry weeps dost live long.
__label__QueenMargaret Tell me, good fellow, camest chance,
Or devotion, holy shrine?
__label__Antony My good knave Eros, captain is
Even body: I Antony:
Yet hold visible shape, knave.
I wars Egypt: queen,--
Whose heart I thought I had, mine;
Which whilst annex'd unto't
A million more, lost,--she, Eros, has
Pack'd cards Caesar, false-play'd glory
Unto enemy's triumph.
Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; left us
Ourselves end ourselves.
[Enter MARDIAN]
O! vile lady!
She robb'd sword.
__label__Cleopatra What's name?
__label__QueenMargaret Enforced thee! art king, wilt forced?
I shame hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
Thou hast undone thyself, son me;
And given unto house York head
As shalt reign sufferance.
To entail heirs unto crown,
What it, sepulchre
And creep far time?
Warwick chancellor lord Calais;
Stern Falconbridge commands narrow seas;
The duke protector realm;
And shalt safe? safety finds
The trembling lamb environed wolves.
Had I there, silly woman,
The soldiers toss'd pikes
Before I granted act.
But preferr'st life thine honour:
And seeing dost, I divorce myself
Both table, Henry, bed,
Until act parliament repeal'd
Whereby son disinherited.
The northern lords forsworn colours
Will follow mine, spread;
And spread shall be, foul disgrace
And utter ruin house York.
Thus I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
Our army ready; come, we'll them.
__label__Cleopatra Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs lord!
Our strength gone heaviness,
That makes weight: I great Juno's power,
The strong-wing'd Mercury fetch thee up,
And set thee Jove's side. Yet come little,--
Wishes fools,--O, come, come, come;
[They heave MARK ANTONY aloft CLEOPATRA]
And welcome, welcome! die hast lived:
Quicken kissing: lips power,
Thus I wear out.
__label__Antony All lost;
This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
My fleet hath yielded foe; yonder
They cast caps carouse together
Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
'tis thou
Hast sold novice; heart
Makes wars thee. Bid fly;
For I revenged charm,
I all. Bid fly; begone.
[Exit SCARUS]
O sun, uprise shall I more:
Fortune Antony here; here
Do shake hands. All come this? The hearts
That spaniel'd heels, I gave
Their wishes, discandy, melt sweets
On blossoming Caesar; pine bark'd,
That overtopp'd all. Betray'd I am:
O false soul Egypt! grave charm,--
Whose eye beck'd forth wars, call'd home;
Whose bosom crownet, chief end,--
Like right gipsy, hath, fast loose,
Beguiled heart loss.
What, Eros, Eros!
[Enter CLEOPATRA]
Ah, spell! Avaunt!
__label__Cleopatra Nay, 'tis certain, Iras: saucy lictors
Will catch us, like strumpets; scald rhymers
Ballad o' tune: quick comedians
Extemporally stage us, present
Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
Shall brought drunken forth, I shall see
Some squeaking Cleopatra boy greatness
I' posture whore.
__label__Cleopatra O, is't come this?
__label__QueenMargaret Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.

__label__QueenMargaret Richard!
__label__QueenMargaret Out, devil! I remember well:
Thou slewest husband Henry Tower,
And Edward, poor son, Tewksbury.
__label__Cleopatra What I kept back?
__label__Antony Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
She hath betray'd shall die death.
__label__Antony And art honest too.
I wish I men,
And clapp'd in
An Antony, I service
So good done.
__label__Antony But royalty
Holds idleness subject, I you
For idleness itself.
__label__QueenMargaret Mine, fill heart unhoped joys.
__label__Cleopatra I dare not, dear,--
Dear lord, pardon,--I dare not,
Lest I taken: imperious show
Of full-fortuned Caesar shall
Be brooch'd me; knife, drugs,
serpents, have
Edge, sting, operation, I safe:
Your wife Octavia, modest eyes
And conclusion, shall acquire honour
Demuring me. But come, come, Antony,--
Help me, women,--we draw thee up:
Assist, good friends.
__label__Antony Thrice-nobler myself!
Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
I should, couldst not. My queen Eros
Have brave instruction got me
A nobleness record: I be
A bridegroom death, run into't
As lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
Thy master dies scholar: thus
[Falling sword]
I learn'd thee. How! dead? dead?
The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
__label__Cleopatra Good lord,--
__label__Cleopatra Give music; music, moody food
Of trade love.
__label__Antony Why cross exigent?
__label__Cleopatra Call noble captains lord.
__label__Cleopatra Nay, I'll help too.
What's for?
__label__Cleopatra Help me, women! O, mad
Than Telamon shield; boar Thessaly

__label__Cleopatra Didst behold Octavia?
__label__Antony When send thee?
__label__QueenMargaret Peace, impudent shameless Warwick, peace,
Proud setter puller kings!
I hence, till, talk tears,
Both truth, I King Lewis behold
Thy sly conveyance lord's false love;
For birds selfsame feather.
__label__Antony Ah, be, be! art

__label__QueenMargaret Ah, barbarous villains! hath lovely face
Ruled, like wandering planet, me,
And enforce relent,
That unworthy behold same?
__label__Cleopatra He married?
__label__QueenMargaret Great lords, wise men ne'er sit wail loss,
But cheerly seek redress harms.
What mast blown overboard,
The cable broke, holding-anchor lost,
And half sailors swallow'd flood?
Yet lives pilot still. Is't meet he
Should leave helm like fearful lad
With tearful eyes add water sea
And strength hath much,
Whiles, moan, ship splits rock,
Which industry courage saved?
Ah, shame! ah, fault this!
Say Warwick anchor; that?
And Montague topmost; him?
Our slaughter'd friends tackles; these?
Why, Oxford anchor?
And Somerset goodly mast?
The friends France shrouds tacklings?
And, unskilful, Ned I
For allow'd skilful pilot's charge?
We helm sit weep,
But course, rough wind no,
From shelves rocks threaten wreck.
As good chide waves speak fair.
And Edward ruthless sea?
What Clarence quicksand deceit?
And Richard ragged fatal rock?
All enemies poor bark.
Say swim; alas, 'tis while!
Tread sand; why, quickly sink:
Bestride rock; tide wash off,
Or famish; that's threefold death.
This speak I, lords, understand,
If case fly us,
That there's hoped-for mercy brothers
More ruthless waves, sands rocks.
Why, courage then! avoided
'Twere childish weakness lament fear.
__label__QueenMargaret He talks random; sure, man mad.
__label__QueenMargaret Marry, God forfend!
__label__QueenMargaret Tush, women captivate ere now.
__label__Cleopatra My resolution hands I'll trust;
None Caesar.
__label__Cleopatra Thou teachest like fool; way lose him.
__label__Antony Will Caesar speak?
__label__Cleopatra Nay, pray you, seek colour going,
But bid farewell, go: sued staying,
Then time words: going then;
Eternity lips eyes,
Bliss brows' bent; parts poor,
But race heaven: still,
Or thou, greatest soldier world,
Art turn'd greatest liar.
__label__Antony You boggler ever:
But viciousness grow hard--
O misery on't!--the wise gods seel eyes;
In filth drop clear judgments; us
Adore errors; laugh at's, strut
To confusion.
__label__QueenMargaret This cheers heart, forwardness.
__label__QueenMargaret Are butcher, Suffolk? Where's knife?
Is Beaufort term'd kite? Where talons?
__label__Cleopatra It birth-day:
I thought held poor: but, lord
Is Antony again, I Cleopatra.
__label__Cleopatra His legs bestrid ocean: rear'd arm
Crested world: voice propertied
As tuned spheres, friends;
But meant quail shake orb,
He rattling thunder. For bounty,
There winter in't; autumn 'twas
That grew reaping: delights
Were dolphin-like; show'd above
The element lived in: livery
Walk'd crowns crownets; realms islands were
As plates dropp'd pocket.
__label__QueenMargaret Oft I heard grief softens mind,
And makes fearful degenerate;
Think revenge cease weep.
But cease weep look this?
Here head lie throbbing breast:
But where's body I embrace?
__label__QueenMargaret Urge charity shame me:
Uncharitably dealt,
And shamefully hopes butcher'd.
My charity outrage, life shame
And shame live sorrow's rage.
__label__Cleopatra I thing ask yet, good Charmian:
But 'tis matter; shalt bring me
Where I write. All enough.
__label__QueenMargaret O, kill too!
__label__Antony Hear me, queen:
The strong necessity time commands
Our services awhile; heart
Remains use you. Our Italy
Shines o'er civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
Makes approaches port Rome:
Equality domestic powers
Breed scrupulous faction: hated, grown strength,
Are newly grown love: condemn'd Pompey,
Rich father's honour, creeps apace,
Into hearts thrived
Upon present state, numbers threaten;
And quietness, grown sick rest, purge
By desperate change: particular,
And safe going,
Is Fulvia's death.
__label__Antony But yesterday word Caesar might
Have stood world; lies there.
And poor reverence.
O masters, I disposed stir
Your hearts minds mutiny rage,
I Brutus wrong, Cassius wrong,
Who, know, honourable men:
I wrong; I choose
To wrong dead, wrong you,
Than I wrong honourable men.
But here's parchment seal Caesar;
I found closet, 'tis will:
Let commons hear testament--
Which, pardon me, I mean read--
And kiss dead Caesar's wounds
And dip napkins sacred blood,
Yea, beg hair memory,
And, dying, mention wills,
Bequeathing rich legacy
Unto issue.
__label__Antony I haste hence.
__label__Cleopatra How unlike art Mark Antony!
Yet, coming him, great medicine hath
With tinct gilded thee.
How goes brave Mark Antony?
__label__QueenMargaret Thou hadst Clarence too, Richard kill'd him.
From forth kennel womb hath crept
A hell-hound doth hunt death:
That dog, teeth eyes,
To worry lambs lap gentle blood,
That foul defacer God's handiwork,
That excellent grand tyrant earth,
That reigns galled eyes weeping souls,
Thy womb loose, chase graves.
O upright, just, true-disposing God,
How I thank thee, carnal cur
Preys issue mother's body,
And makes pew-fellow others' moan!
__label__Cleopatra I paid for't now.
Lead hence:
I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis matter.
Go fellow, good Alexas; bid him
Report feature Octavia, years,
Her inclination, leave out
The colour hair: bring word quickly.
[Exit ALEXAS]
Let go:--let not--Charmian,
Though painted way like Gorgon,
The way's Mars. Bid Alexas
[To MARDIAN]
Bring word tall is. Pity me, Charmian,
But speak me. Lead chamber.
__label__Antony Most sweet queen,--
__label__Cleopatra Courteous lord, word.
Sir, I part, that's it:
Sir, I loved, there's it;
That know well: I would,
O, oblivion Antony,
And I forgotten.
__label__Antony Now I must
To young man send humble treaties, dodge
And palter shifts lowness; who
With half bulk o' world play'd I pleased,
Making marring fortunes. You know
How conqueror; that
My sword, weak affection, would
Obey cause.
__label__Antony Dead, then?
__label__Antony I married, Caesar: hear
Agrippa speak.
__label__Antony Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
The enemies Caesar shall this;
Then, friend, cold modesty.
__label__Antony I doubt wisdom.
Let man render bloody hand:
First, Marcus Brutus, I shake you;
Next, Caius Cassius, I hand;
Now, Decius Brutus, yours: yours, Metellus;
Yours, Cinna; and, valiant Casca, yours;
Though last, love, yours, good Trebonius.
Gentlemen all,--alas, shall I say?
My credit stands slippery ground,
That bad ways conceit me,
Either coward flatterer.
That I love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
If spirit look now,
Shall grieve thee dearer death,
To Anthony making peace,
Shaking bloody fingers foes,
Most noble! presence corse?
Had I eyes hast wounds,
Weeping fast stream forth blood,
It better close
In terms friendship thine enemies.
Pardon me, Julius! Here wast bay'd, brave hart;
Here didst fall; hunters stand,
Sign'd spoil, crimson'd lethe.
O world, wast forest hart;
And this, indeed, O world, heart thee.
How like deer, strucken princes,
Dost lie!
__label__QueenMargaret What noise this?
[Re-enter SUFFOLK WARWICK, their]
weapons drawn]
__label__Cleopatra No matter, sir, I heard known.
You laugh boys women tell dreams;
Is't trick?
__label__Antony Speak home, mince general tongue:
Name Cleopatra call'd Rome;
Rail Fulvia's phrase; taunt faults
With licence truth malice
Have power utter. O, bring forth weeds,
When quick minds lie still; ills told us
Is earing. Fare thee awhile.
__label__Antony What say'st thou?
__label__Cleopatra O, fault knave thee,
That art thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
The merchandise hast brought Rome
Are dear me: lie hand,
And undone 'em!
__label__Antony That's I seek:
And suitor I may
Produce body market-place;
And pulpit, friend,
Speak order funeral.
__label__Antony Then once
The thing hast drawn it.
__label__QueenMargaret Enough, sweet Suffolk; torment'st thyself;
And dread curses, like sun 'gainst glass,
Or like overcharged gun, recoil,
And turn force thyself.
__label__Antony Well said; come on.
Call forth household servants: let's to-night
Be bounteous meal.
[Enter Servitors]
Give hand,
Thou hast rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you served well,
And kings fellows.
__label__Cleopatra Indeed!
__label__Antony Gentle, hear me:
None Caesar trust Proculeius.
__label__QueenMargaret Warwick, words turn'd hate love;
And I forgive forget old faults,
And joy becomest King Henry's friend.
__label__Antony Who's gone morning?
__label__Antony You heard much.
__label__Cleopatra O Charmian,
Where think'st now? Stands he, sits he?
Or walk? horse?
O happy horse, bear weight Antony!
Do bravely, horse! wot'st movest?
The demi-Atlas earth, arm
And burgonet men. He's speaking now,
Or murmuring 'Where's serpent old Nile?'
For calls me: I feed myself
With delicious poison. Think me,
That Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
And wrinkled deep time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
When wast ground, I was
A morsel monarch: great Pompey
Would stand eyes grow brow;
There anchor aspect die
With looking life.
__label__Antony Bear me, good friends, Cleopatra bides;
'Tis service I shall command you.
__label__Antony Moon stars!
Whip him. Were't greatest tributaries
That acknowledge Caesar, I find them
So saucy hand here,--what's name,
Since Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
Till, like boy, cringe face,
And whine aloud mercy: hence.
__label__Cleopatra Hear ambassadors.
__label__Cleopatra Who's born day
When I forget send Antony,
Shall die beggar. Ink paper, Charmian.
Welcome, good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
Ever love Caesar so?
__label__Cleopatra That head, lord?
__label__Cleopatra Pardon, pardon!
__label__QueenMargaret And I answer me.
__label__Cleopatra Seek him, bring hither.
Where's Alexas?
__label__Cleopatra Well, thee gone; farewell.
__label__Antony Come, then; wound I cured.
Draw honest sword, hast worn
Most useful country.
__label__Antony O fie, fie, fie!
__label__Antony Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend ears;
I come bury Caesar, praise him.
The evil men lives them;
The good oft interred bones;
So Caesar. The noble Brutus
Hath told Caesar ambitious:
If so, grievous fault,
And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
Here, leave Brutus rest--
For Brutus honourable man;
So all, honourable men--
Come I speak Caesar's funeral.
He friend, faithful me:
But Brutus says ambitious;
And Brutus honourable man.
He hath brought captives home Rome
Whose ransoms general coffers fill:
Did Caesar ambitious?
When poor cried, Caesar hath wept:
Ambition sterner stuff:
Yet Brutus says ambitious;
And Brutus honourable man.
You Lupercal
I thrice presented kingly crown,
Which thrice refuse: ambition?
Yet Brutus says ambitious;
And, sure, honourable man.
I speak disprove Brutus spoke,
But I speak I know.
You love once, cause:
What cause withholds then, mourn him?
O judgment! art fled brutish beasts,
And men lost reason. Bear me;
My heart coffin Caesar,
And I pause till come me.
__label__Antony That I, Pompey.
__label__Antony Thy heart big, thee apart weep.
Passion, I see, catching; eyes,
Seeing beads sorrow stand thine,
Began water. Is master coming?
__label__Cleopatra What shall do, Enobarbus?
__label__Antony The beds i' east soft; thanks you,
That call'd timelier purpose hither;
For I gain'd 't.
__label__Cleopatra Say, I die.
__label__Cleopatra Sleep little.
__label__Cleopatra Make thee fortune me.
__label__QueenMargaret Not lords vex half much
As proud dame, lord protector's wife.
She sweeps court troops ladies,
More like empress Duke Humphrey's wife:
Strangers court queen:
She bears duke's revenues back,
And heart scorns poverty:
Shall I live avenged her?
Contemptuous base-born callet is,
She vaunted 'mongst minions t'other day,
The train worst wearing gown
Was better worth father's lands,
Till Suffolk gave dukedoms daughter.
__label__QueenMargaret What snarling I came,
Ready catch throat,
And turn hatred me?
Did York's dread curse prevail heaven?
That Henry's death, lovely Edward's death,
Their kingdom's loss, woful banishment,
Could answer peevish brat?
Can curses pierce clouds enter heaven?
Why, then, way, dull clouds, quick curses!
If war, surfeit die king,
As murder, king!
Edward son, Prince Wales,
For Edward son, Prince Wales,
Die youth like untimely violence!
Thyself queen, queen,
Outlive glory, like wretched self!
Long mayst live wail children's loss;
And another, I thee now,
Deck'd rights, art stall'd mine!
Long die happy days death;
And, lengthen'd hours grief,
Die mother, wife, England's queen!
Rivers Dorset, standers by,
And wast thou, Lord Hastings, son
Was stabb'd bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
That live natural age,
But unlook'd accident cut off!
__label__Cleopatra Where he?
__label__QueenMargaret Ay, good lord; purposely therefore
Left I court, quarrel tried.
__label__Antony Would I seen her.
__label__Cleopatra You better yet; meetly.
__label__QueenMargaret Hie thee hell shame, leave world,
Thou cacodemon! kingdom is.
__label__Antony I gone.
__label__Antony Yet hear me, countrymen; hear speak.
__label__QueenMargaret Nay, bear hence, dispatch here,
Here sheathe sword, I'll pardon thee death:
What, wilt not? then, Clarence, thou.
__label__QueenMargaret Beside haughty protector, Beaufort,
The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
And grumbling York: these
But England king.
__label__QueenMargaret Defy then, hold close lips.
__label__Antony Here will, Caesar's seal.
To Roman citizen gives,
To man, seventy-five drachmas.
__label__Cleopatra This proves base:
If meet curled Antony,
He'll demand her, spend kiss
Which heaven have. Come, thou
mortal wretch,
[To asp, applies breast]
With sharp teeth knot intrinsicate
Of life untie: poor venomous fool
Be angry, dispatch. O, couldst speak,
That I hear thee great Caesar ass
Unpolicied!
__label__Antony They retire.
__label__Antony She's dead, queen:
Look here, sovereign leisure read
The garboils awaked; last, best:
See died.
__label__Cleopatra I hurt him.
[Exit CHARMIAN]
These hands lack nobility, strike
A meaner myself; I myself
Have given cause.
[Re-enter CHARMIAN Messenger]
Come hither, sir.
Though honest, good
To bring bad news: gracious message.
An host tongues; ill tidings tell
Themselves felt.
__label__Cleopatra My master, lord!
__label__Antony Eros,
Wouldst window'd great Rome see
Thy master pleach'd arms, bending down
His corrigible neck, face subdued
To penetrative shame, whilst wheel'd seat
Of fortunate Caesar, drawn him, branded
His baseness ensued?
__label__Cleopatra O!
__label__Antony We beat camp: run before,
And queen know gests. To-morrow,
Before sun shall 's, we'll spill blood
That to-day escaped. I thank all;
For doughty-handed you, fought
Not served cause, 't been
Each man's like mine; shown Hectors.
Enter city, clip wives, friends,
Tell feats; whilst joyful tears
Wash congealment wounds, kiss
The honour'd gashes whole.
[To SCARUS]
Give hand
[Enter CLEOPATRA, attended]
To great fairy I'll commend acts,
Make thanks bless thee.

Take course wilt!

O, young nobility judge
What 'twere lose it, miserable!
They stand high blasts shake them;
And fall, dash pieces.
__label__Antony Thou bleed'st apace.
__label__Antony Bear ashore. I'll pledge him, Pompey.
__label__Cleopatra And may, world: 'tis yours; we,
Your scutcheons signs conquest, shall
Hang place please. Here, good lord.
__label__Antony Alack, terrene moon
Is eclipsed; portends alone
The fall Antony!
__label__Antony Now, sirrah; wish Egypt?
__label__QueenMargaret Yes, good lord, pure unspotted heart,
Never taint love, I send king.
__label__Antony I offended reputation,
A unnoble swerving.
__label__QueenMargaret Perhaps I shall rescued French;
And I need crave courtesy.
__label__Antony It ripens it. Strike vessels, ho?
Here Caesar!
__label__QueenMargaret My hope gone, Suffolk deceased.
__label__QueenMargaret But repetition hast marr'd;
That I I thee go.
__label__QueenMargaret Fie, coward woman soft-hearted wretch!
Hast spirit curse thine enemy?
__label__QueenMargaret Go tell heavy message king.
[Exit VAUX]
Ay me! world! news these!
But wherefore grieve I hour's poor loss,
Omitting Suffolk's exile, soul's treasure?
Why only, Suffolk, mourn I thee,
And southern clouds contend tears,
Theirs earth's increase, sorrows?
Now thee hence: king, know'st, coming;
If found me, art dead.
__label__Cleopatra If denounced us, we
Be person?
__label__Antony Lo thee!
__label__Cleopatra He'll lead me, then, triumph?
__label__QueenMargaret Mischance sorrow you!
Heart's discontent sour affliction
Be playfellows company!
There's you; devil third!
And threefold vengeance tend steps!
__label__Cleopatra This treasurer: speak, lord,
Upon peril, I reserved
To nothing. Speak truth, Seleucus.
__label__QueenMargaret But I loser leave chide.
__label__Antony Villains, so, vile daggers
Hack'd sides Caesar:
You show'd teeth like apes, fawn'd like hounds,
And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
Whilst damned Casca, like cur, behind
Struck Caesar neck. O flatterers!
__label__QueenMargaret Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, it.
__label__QueenMargaret [Reading] 'To Lord Protector!' Are your
supplications lordship? Let them:
what thine?
__label__QueenMargaret Nay, then, spark prove raging fire,
If wind fuel brought feed with:
No more, good York; sweet Somerset, still:
Thy fortune, York, hadst regent there,
Might happily proved far worse his.
__label__QueenMargaret Call hither Clifford! bid come amain,
To bastard boys York
Shall surety traitor father.
__label__QueenMargaret Why rate Lord Suffolk thus?
Although duke enemy him,
Yet Christian-like laments death:
And myself, foe me,
Might liquid tears heart-offending groans
Or blood-consuming sighs recall life,
I blind weeping, sick groans,
Look pale primrose blood-drinking sighs,
And noble duke alive.
What know I world deem me?
For known hollow friends:
It judged I duke away;
So shall slander's tongue wounded,
And princes' courts fill'd reproach.
This I death: ay me, unhappy!
To queen, crown'd infamy!
__label__Antony No, no, no, no, no.
__label__Antony This noblest Roman all:
All conspirators save he
Did envy great Caesar;
He only, general honest thought
And common good all, them.
His life gentle, elements
So mix'd Nature stand up
And world 'This man!'
__label__QueenMargaret I was; I find pain banishment
Than death yield abode.
A husband son owest me;
And kingdom; allegiance:
The sorrow I have, right yours,
And pleasures usurp mine.
__label__Antony Egypt, knew'st well
My heart rudder tied strings,
And shouldst tow after: o'er spirit
Thy supremacy knew'st, that
Thy beck bidding gods
Command me.
__label__Antony Her tongue obey heart, can
Her heart inform tongue,--the swan's
down-feather,
That stands swell tide,
And way inclines.
__label__Antony Go, Eros, send treasure after; it;
Detain jot, I charge thee: write him--
I subscribe--gentle adieus greetings;
Say I wish find cause
To change master. O, fortunes have
Corrupted honest men! Dispatch.--Enobarbus!
__label__Cleopatra Indeed, so: I repent much
That I harried him. Why, methinks, him,
This creature's thing.
__label__Antony I sorry breathing purpose,--
__label__Cleopatra Why I think true,
Though swearing shake throned gods,
Who false Fulvia? Riotous madness,
To entangled mouth-made vows,
Which break swearing!
__label__Cleopatra Cut lace, Charmian, come;
But be: I quickly ill, well,
So Antony loves.
__label__QueenMargaret And comes Clifford deny bail.
__label__Antony Tut, I bosoms, I know
Wherefore it: content
To visit places; come down
With fearful bravery, thinking face
To fasten thoughts courage;
But 'tis so.
__label__QueenMargaret What of? you'll fight fly:
Now manhood, wisdom defence,
To enemy way, secure us
By can, fly.
[Alarum afar off]
If ta'en, bottom
Of fortunes: haply scape,
As may, neglect,
We shall London get, loved
And breach fortunes made
May readily stopp'd.
__label__Cleopatra Help away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
It long, sides nature
Will sustain it.
__label__Antony How, love!
__label__Cleopatra Thou, eunuch Mardian!
__label__QueenMargaret This way me.
__label__QueenMargaret Ah, what's dangerous fond affiance!
Seems dove? feathers borrowed,
For he's disposed hateful raven:
Is lamb? skin surely lent him,
For he's inclined ravenous wolf.
Who steal shape means deceit?
Take heed, lord; welfare all
Hangs cutting short fraudful man.
__label__Cleopatra Antony
Did tell you, bade trust you; but
I greatly care deceived,
That use trusting. If master
Would queen beggar, tell him,
That majesty, decorum, must
No beg kingdom: please
To conquer'd Egypt son,
He gives own, I
Will kneel thanks.
__label__Cleopatra Rememberest died on't?
__label__Cleopatra O false love!
Where sacred vials shouldst fill
With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
In Fulvia's death, received shall be.
__label__Antony Eros! armour, Eros!
__label__Antony I heard it, Pompey;
And studied liberal thanks
Which I owe you.
__label__QueenMargaret O, impatience waiteth true sorrow.
And comes breeder sorrow!
__label__QueenMargaret So, prosperity begins mellow
And drop rotten mouth death.
Here confines slily I lurk'd,
To watch waning adversaries.
A dire induction I witness to,
And France, hoping consequence
Will prove bitter, black, tragical.
Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: comes here?
__label__QueenMargaret It laugh villain run.
__label__Cleopatra Dolabella,
I shall remain debtor.
__label__Antony Be child o' time.
__label__Cleopatra Some innocents 'scape thunderbolt.
Melt Egypt Nile! kindly creatures
Turn serpents! Call slave again:
Though I mad, I bite him: call.
__label__Cleopatra Let come in.
[Exit Guardsman]
What poor instrument
May noble deed! brings liberty.
My resolution's placed, I nothing
Of woman me: head foot
I marble-constant; fleeting moon
No planet mine.
__label__Antony Be so.
I desire more.
__label__Cleopatra See, Caesar! O, behold,
How pomp follow'd! yours;
And, shift estates, mine.
The ingratitude Seleucus does
Even wild: O slave, trust
Than love that's hired! What, goest back? shalt
Go back, I warrant thee; I'll catch thine eyes,
Though wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
O rarely base!
__label__Cleopatra Ah, dear, I so,
From cold heart heaven engender hail,
And poison source; stone
Drop neck: determines, so
Dissolve life! The Caesarion smite!
Till degrees memory womb,
Together brave Egyptians all,
By discandying pelleted storm,
Lie graveless, till flies gnats Nile
Have buried prey!
__label__Antony He shall live; look, spot I damn him.
But, Lepidus, Caesar's house;
Fetch hither, shall determine
How cut charge legacies.
__label__Cleopatra The man hath seen majesty, know.
__label__Cleopatra None friends: boldly.
__label__QueenMargaret And I.
__label__Antony Antony, wouldst say,--
__label__QueenMargaret What, dost scorn gentle counsel?
And soothe devil I warn thee from?
O, remember day,
When shall split heart sorrow,
And poor Margaret prophetess!
Live subjects hate,
And yours, God's!
__label__Cleopatra 'Tis sweating labour
To bear idleness near heart
As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
Since becomings kill me, not
Eye you: honour calls hence;
Therefore deaf unpitied folly.
And gods you! sword
Sit laurel victory! smooth success
Be strew'd feet!
__label__Antony Let go. Come;
Our separation abides, flies,
That thou, residing here, go'st me,
And I, fleeting, remain thee. Away!
__label__QueenMargaret Foul shame you! moved mine.
__label__Cleopatra What you? Hence,
[Strikes again]
Horrible villain! I'll spurn thine eyes
Like balls me; I'll unhair head:
[She hales down]
Thou shalt whipp'd wire, stew'd brine,
Smarting lingering pickle.
__label__Cleopatra For part, too, foolish so.
Her hair, colour?
__label__Antony In bad strokes, Brutus, good words:
Witness hole Caesar's heart,
Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
__label__QueenMargaret Gloucester, tainture nest.
And look thyself faultless, wert best.
__label__QueenMargaret Thy woes sharp, pierce like mine.
__label__Antony If can, reason?
__label__Antony Since Cleopatra died,
I lived dishonour, gods
Detest baseness. I, sword
Quarter'd world, o'er green Neptune's back
With ships cities, condemn lack
The courage woman; noble mind
Than death Caesar tells
'I conqueror myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
That, exigent come, now
Is come indeed, I me
The inevitable prosecution of
Disgrace horror, that, command,
Thou wouldst kill me: do't; time come:
Thou strikest me, 'tis Caesar defeat'st.
Put colour cheek.
__label__Cleopatra [Aside DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS] What means this?
__label__Cleopatra Rogue, hast lived long.
__label__QueenMargaret They sale offices towns France,
If known, suspect great,
Would thee quickly hop head.
[Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops fan]
Give fan: what, minion! ye not?
[She gives DUCHESS box ear]
I cry mercy, madam; you?
__label__Cleopatra Charmian!
__label__Antony Octavius, lead battle softly on,
Upon left hand field.
__label__Antony Is answer?
__label__QueenMargaret Wither goes Vaux fast? news, I prithee?
__label__Antony Stay, countrymen.
__label__Cleopatra Say 'tis so, province I thee,
And fortunes proud: blow hadst
Shall peace moving rage;
And I boot thee gift beside
Thy modesty beg.
__label__Cleopatra O well-divided disposition! Note him,
Note good Charmian, 'tis man; note him:
He sad, shine those
That looks his; merry,
Which seem'd tell remembrance lay
In Egypt joy; both:
O heavenly mingle! Be'st sad merry,
The violence thee becomes,
So man else. Met'st posts?
__label__Cleopatra Why, that's way
To fool preparation, conquer
Their absurd intents.
[Re-enter CHARMIAN]
Now, Charmian!
Show me, women, like queen: fetch
My best attires: I Cydnus,
To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
And, hast chare, I'll thee leave
To play till doomsday. Bring crown all.
Wherefore's noise?
__label__Cleopatra His face heavens; stuck
A sun moon, kept course,
and lighted
The little O, earth.
__label__QueenMargaret Our Earl Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
__label__Cleopatra I'll thee, friend,
An armour gold; king's.
__label__Antony O, hast led me, Egypt? See,
How I convey shame thine eyes
By looking I left behind
'Stroy'd dishonour.
__label__Antony No, Caesar, answer charge.
Make forth; generals words.
__label__QueenMargaret [Aside] If forward, Henry's hope done.
__label__Antony And fair words them.
__label__Antony Hear patience.
__label__Cleopatra No, speak; rail high,
That false housewife Fortune break wheel,
Provoked offence.
__label__Cleopatra Excellent falsehood!
Why marry Fulvia, love her?
I'll fool I not; Antony
Will himself.
__label__Cleopatra O Charmian, I hence.
__label__Antony You wrong presence; speak more.
__label__Antony Octavius, I seen days you:
And lay honours man,
To ease divers slanderous loads,
He shall bear ass bears gold,
To groan sweat business,
Either led driven, point way;
And having brought treasure will,
Then load, turn off,
Like ass, shake ears,
And graze commons.
__label__Antony Ho, ho, ho!
Now witch me, I meant thus!
Grace grow drops fall!
My hearty friends,
You dolorous sense;
For I spake comfort; desire you
To burn night torches: know, hearts,
I hope to-morrow; lead you
Where I'll expect victorious life
Than death honour. Let's supper, come,
And drown consideration.
__label__Cleopatra Is buckled well?
