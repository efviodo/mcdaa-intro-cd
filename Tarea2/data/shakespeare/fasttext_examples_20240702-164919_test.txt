__label__Cleopatra Didst hear speak? shrill-tongued low?
__label__QueenMargaret Deceitful Warwick! device
By alliance void suit:
Before coming Lewis Henry's friend.
__label__Antony And shall, sir; give's hand.
__label__Cleopatra Nay, that's certain.
__label__QueenMargaret Nay, me; I follow thee.
__label__QueenMargaret A murderous villain, art.
__label__Antony I dying, Egypt, dying; only
I importune death awhile, until
Of thousand kisses poor last
I lay lips.
__label__Antony Their preparation to-day sea;
We land.
__label__Antony Let appear.
These strong Egyptian fetters I break,
Or lose dotage.
[Enter Messenger]
What you?
__label__Cleopatra I pale, Charmian.
__label__Antony May I never
To good purpose, fairly shows,
Dream impediment! Let hand:
Further act grace: hour
The heart brothers govern loves
And sway great designs!
__label__Cleopatra I sails, Caesar better.
__label__Cleopatra This brief money, plate, jewels,
I possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
__label__Cleopatra Peace, peace!
Dost baby breast,
That sucks nurse asleep?
__label__Cleopatra Nay, pray you, sir,--
__label__Antony So horse, Octavius; that
I appoint store provender:
It creature I teach fight,
To wind, stop, run directly on,
His corporal motion govern'd spirit.
And, taste, Lepidus so;
He taught train'd bid forth;
A barren-spirited fellow; feeds
On abjects, orts imitations,
Which, use staled men,
Begin fashion: talk him,
But property. And now, Octavius,
Listen great things:--Brutus Cassius
Are levying powers: straight head:
Therefore alliance combined,
Our best friends made, means stretch'd
And presently sit council,
How covert matters best disclosed,
And open perils surest answered.
__label__QueenMargaret Brave warriors, Clifford Northumberland,
Come, stand molehill here,
That raught mountains outstretched arms,
Yet parted shadow hand.
What! England's king?
Was't revell'd parliament,
And preachment high descent?
Where mess sons now?
The wanton Edward, lusty George?
And where's valiant crook-back prodigy,
Dicky boy, grumbling voice
Was wont cheer dad mutinies?
Or, rest, darling Rutland?
Look, York: I stain'd napkin blood
That valiant Clifford, rapier's point,
Made issue bosom boy;
And thine eyes water death,
I thee dry cheeks withal.
Alas poor York! I hate thee deadly,
I lament miserable state.
I prithee, grieve, merry, York.
What, hath fiery heart parch'd thine entrails
That tear fall Rutland's death?
Why art patient, man? shouldst mad;
And I, thee mad, mock thee thus.
Stamp, rave, fret, I sing dance.
Thou wouldst fee'd, I see, sport:
York speak, wear crown.
A crown York! and, lords, bow low him:
Hold hands, whilst I set on.
[Putting paper crown head]
Ay, marry, sir, looks like king!
Ay, took King Henry's chair,
And adopted heir.
But great Plantagenet
Is crown'd soon, broke solemn oath?
As I bethink me, king
Till King Henry shook hands death.
And pale head Henry's glory,
And rob temples diadem,
Now life, holy oath?
O, 'tis fault unpardonable!
Off crown, crown head;
And, whilst breathe, time dead.
__label__Cleopatra Sink Rome, tongues rot
That speak us! A charge bear i' war,
And, president kingdom, will
Appear man. Speak it:
I stay behind.
__label__Antony Where she?
__label__QueenMargaret Forbear sleep nights, fast days;
Compare dead happiness living woe;
Think babes fairer were,
And slew fouler is:
Bettering loss makes bad causer worse:
Revolving teach thee curse.
__label__Antony To-morrow, soldier,
By sea land I'll fight: I live,
Or bathe dying honour blood
Shall live again. Woo't fight well?
__label__Antony You mistake business; brother never
Did urge act: I inquire it;
And learning true reports,
That drew swords you. Did rather
Discredit authority yours;
And wars alike stomach,
Having alike cause? Of letters
Before satisfy you. If you'll patch quarrel,
As matter with,
It this.
__label__Cleopatra O, 'tis treason!
__label__Antony With health Pompey gives him, a
very epicure.
__label__Cleopatra Think was, be, man
As I dream'd of?
__label__Antony 'Tis blown, lads:
This morning, like spirit youth
That means note, begins betimes.
So, so; come, that: way; said.
Fare thee well, dame, whate'er me:
This soldier's kiss: rebukeable
[Kisses her]
And worthy shameful cheque were, stand
On mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
Now, like man steel. You fight,
Follow close; I'll bring to't. Adieu.
__label__Cleopatra The gods confound thee! dost hold still?
__label__QueenMargaret My lord, cheer spirits: foes nigh,
And soft courage makes followers faint.
You promised knighthood forward son:
Unsheathe sword, dub presently.
Edward, kneel down.
__label__QueenMargaret I told majesty before:
This proveth Edward's love Warwick's honesty.
__label__QueenMargaret No, mighty King France: Margaret
Must strike sail learn awhile serve
Where kings command. I was, I confess,
Great Albion's queen golden days:
But mischance hath trod title down,
And dishonour laid ground;
Where I like seat unto fortune,
And humble seat conform myself.
__label__Antony Yes, lord, yes; Philippi kept
His sword e'en like dancer; I struck
The lean wrinkled Cassius; 'twas I
That mad Brutus ended: alone
Dealt lieutenantry, practise had
In brave squares war: now--No matter.
__label__Cleopatra What's name?
__label__Antony When concerns fool coward. On:
Things past me. 'Tis thus:
Who tells true, tale lie death,
I hear flatter'd.
__label__Cleopatra Ha, ha!
Give drink mandragora.
__label__Antony Unarm, Eros; long day's task done,
And sleep.
[To MARDIAN]
That depart'st safe,
Does pay labour richly; go.
[Exit MARDIAN]
Off, pluck off:
The seven-fold shield Ajax keep
The battery heart. O, cleave, sides!
Heart, stronger continent,
Crack frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
No soldier: bruised pieces, go;
You nobly borne. From awhile.
[Exit EROS]
I o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
Weep pardon. So be, now
All length torture: torch out,
Lie down, stray farther: labour
Mars does; yea, force entangles
Itself strength: seal then, done.
Eros!--I come, queen:--Eros!--Stay me:
Where souls couch flowers, we'll hand hand,
And sprightly port ghosts gaze:
Dido AEneas shall want troops,
And haunt ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
__label__Cleopatra Let sit down. O Juno!
__label__QueenMargaret And turns sun shade; alas! alas!
Witness son, shade death;
Whose bright out-shining beams cloudy wrath
Hath eternal darkness folded up.
Your aery buildeth aery's nest.
O God, seest it, suffer it!
As won blood, lost so!
__label__Antony Favours, Jove thunders!
What art thou, fellow?
__label__Cleopatra O Caesar, wounding shame this,
That thou, vouchsafing visit me,
Doing honour lordliness
To meek, servant should
Parcel sum disgraces by
Addition envy! Say, good Caesar,
That I lady trifles reserved,
Immoment toys, things dignity
As greet modern friends withal; say,
Some nobler token I kept apart
For Livia Octavia, induce
Their mediation; I unfolded
With I bred? The gods! smites me
Beneath fall I have.
[To SELEUCUS]
Prithee, hence;
Or I shall cinders spirits
Through ashes chance: wert man,
Thou wouldst mercy me.
__label__Antony Farewell!
__label__Cleopatra O, queen
So mightily betray'd! first
I saw treasons planted.
__label__QueenMargaret Free lords, cold snow melts sun's hot beams.
Henry lord cold great affairs,
Too foolish pity, Gloucester's show
Beguiles mournful crocodile
With sorrow snares relenting passengers,
Or snake roll'd flowering bank,
With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting child
That beauty thinks excellent.
Believe me, lords, wise I--
And I judge wit good--
This Gloucester quickly rid world,
To rid fear him.
__label__Antony One word, sweet queen:
Of Caesar seek honour, safety. O!
__label__Cleopatra Prithee, peace.
__label__Cleopatra For good turn?
__label__Antony Fulvia dead.
__label__QueenMargaret Away! parting fretful corrosive,
It applied deathful wound.
To France, sweet Suffolk: hear thee;
For wheresoe'er art world's globe,
I'll Iris shall find thee out.
__label__QueenMargaret To serve well, duty,
Teach queen, subjects:
O, serve well, teach duty!
__label__Cleopatra Perchance! nay, like:
You stay longer, dismission
Is come Caesar; hear it, Antony.
Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I say? both?
Call messengers. As I Egypt's queen,
Thou blushest, Antony; blood thine
Is Caesar's homager: cheek pays shame
When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
__label__Cleopatra Quick, quick, good hands.
__label__Antony I satisfied.
Caesar sits Alexandria; where
I oppose fate. Our force land
Hath nobly held; sever'd navy too
Have knit again, fleet, threatening sea-like.
Where hast been, heart? Dost hear, lady?
If field I shall return more
To kiss lips, I appear blood;
I sword earn chronicle:
There's hope in't yet.
__label__Antony Have patience, gentle friends, I read it;
It meet know Caesar loved you.
You wood, stones, men;
And, men, bearing Caesar,
It inflame you, mad:
'Tis good know heirs;
For, should, O, come it!
__label__Cleopatra I think so, Charmian: dull tongue, dwarfish!
What majesty gait? Remember,
If e'er look'dst majesty.
__label__Cleopatra Go on: right royal.
__label__Cleopatra They together.
__label__QueenMargaret To queen bondage vile
Than slave base servility;
For princes free.
__label__Antony Old Cassius still!
__label__Cleopatra Give robe, crown; I have
Immortal longings me: more
The juice Egypt's grape shall moist lip:
Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
Antony call; I rouse himself
To praise noble act; I hear mock
The luck Caesar, gods men
To excuse wrath: husband, I come:
Now courage prove title!
I fire air; elements
I baser life. So; done?
Come then, warmth lips.
Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
[Kisses them. IRAS falls dies]
Have I aspic lips? Dost fall?
If nature gently part,
The stroke death lover's pinch,
Which hurts, desired. Dost lie still?
If vanishest, tell'st world
It worth leave-taking.
__label__Cleopatra Lead me.
He goes forth gallantly. That Caesar might
Determine great war single fight!
Then Antony,--but now--Well, on.
__label__Antony Cold-hearted me?
__label__Cleopatra Lord lords!
O infinite virtue, comest smiling from
The world's great snare uncaught?
__label__QueenMargaret He dares calm contumelious spirit
Nor cease arrogant controller,
Though Suffolk dare thousand times.
__label__Cleopatra He words me, girls, words me, I not
Be noble myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
__label__Antony Why, friends, know what:
Wherein hath Caesar deserved loves?
Alas, know not: I tell then:
You forgot I told of.
__label__Antony Neglected, rather;
And poison'd hours bound up
From knowledge. As nearly I may,
I'll play penitent you: honesty
Shall poor greatness, power
Work it. Truth is, Fulvia,
To Egypt, wars here;
For myself, ignorant motive, do
So far ask pardon befits honour
To stoop case.
__label__Cleopatra I tell.
__label__Antony Therefore I took hands, was, indeed,
Sway'd point, looking Caesar.
Friends I love all,
Upon hope, shall reasons
Why Caesar dangerous.
__label__QueenMargaret Yea, better blood thine.
__label__Antony If father live, repent
Thou wast daughter; sorry
To follow Caesar triumph, since
Thou hast whipp'd following him: henceforth
The white hand lady fever thee,
Shake look 't. Get thee Caesar,
Tell entertainment: look, say
He makes angry him; seems
Proud disdainful, harping I am,
Not knew I was: makes angry;
And time easy 'tis do't,
When good stars, guides,
Have left orbs, shot fires
Into abysm hell. If mislike
My speech done, tell has
Hipparchus, enfranched bondman, whom
He pleasure whip, hang, torture,
As shall like, quit me: urge thou:
Hence stripes, begone!
__label__QueenMargaret Poor painted queen, vain flourish fortune!
Why strew'st sugar bottled spider,
Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
Fool, fool! whet'st knife kill thyself.
The time come shalt wish me
To help thee curse poisonous bunchback'd toad.
__label__QueenMargaret Great King England gracious lord,
The mutual conference mind hath had,
By day, night, waking dreams,
In courtly company beads,
With you, alder-liefest sovereign,
Makes bolder salute king
With ruder terms, wit affords
And over-joy heart doth minister.
__label__Antony Thou art soldier only: speak more.
__label__Antony Fulvia dead.
__label__Antony I treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
And fight maliciously: hours
Were nice lucky, men ransom lives
Of jests; I'll set teeth,
And send darkness stop me. Come,
Let's gaudy night: me
All sad captains; fill bowls more;
Let's mock midnight bell.
__label__Cleopatra Antonius dead!--If so, villain,
Thou kill'st mistress: free,
If yield him, gold, here
My bluest veins kiss; hand kings
Have lipp'd, trembled kissing.
__label__Cleopatra By sea! else?
__label__Antony For dares to't.
__label__Antony Where died she?
__label__QueenMargaret And lessen'd small, God, I beseech thee!
Thy honour, state seat me.
__label__QueenMargaret Nay, stay; lets hear orisons makes.
__label__Antony That horse, thought
The rack dislimns, makes indistinct,
As water water.
__label__Antony I'll leave you, lady.
__label__Cleopatra By Isis, I thee bloody teeth,
If Caesar paragon again
My man men.
__label__QueenMargaret Yes, I agree, thank motion.
Son Edward, fair virtuous,
Therefore delay not, hand Warwick;
And, hand, faith irrevocable,
That Warwick's daughter shall thine.
__label__Antony Now, sword,--
__label__Antony Let know't.
To boy Caesar send grizzled head,
And fill wishes brim
With principalities.
__label__Antony Good friends, sweet friends, stir up
To sudden flood mutiny.
They deed honourable:
What private griefs have, alas, I know not,
That it: wise honourable,
And will, doubt, reasons answer you.
I come not, friends, steal away hearts:
I orator, Brutus is;
But, know all, plain blunt man,
That love friend; know well
That gave public leave speak him:
For I wit, words, worth,
Action, utterance, power speech,
To stir men's blood: I speak right on;
I tell know;
Show sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
And bid speak me: I Brutus,
And Brutus Antony, Antony
Would ruffle spirits tongue
In wound Caesar move
The stones Rome rise mutiny.
__label__Cleopatra Saw lord?
__label__Antony Let us, Lepidus,
Not lack company.
__label__QueenMargaret Who patient extremes?
Ah, wretched man! I died maid
And seen thee, borne thee son,
Seeing hast proved unnatural father
Hath deserved lose birthright thus?
Hadst loved half I,
Or felt pain I once,
Or nourish'd I blood,
Thou wouldst left dearest heart-blood there,
Rather savage duke thine heir
And disinherited thine son.
__label__Antony Well, well: away!
__label__Antony I think draw sword 'gainst Pompey;
For hath laid strange courtesies great
Of late me: I thank only,
Lest remembrance suffer ill report;
At heel that, defy him.
__label__Antony These quick-sands, Lepidus,
Keep them, sink.
__label__Cleopatra You lie, hearing gods.
But, be, were, such,
It's past size dreaming: nature wants stuff
To vie strange forms fancy; yet, imagine
And Antony, nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
Condemning shadows quite.
__label__Cleopatra He's knowing;
I perceive't: there's yet:
The fellow good judgment.
__label__Cleopatra O lord, lord,
Forgive fearful sails! I little thought
You follow'd.
__label__Antony 'Tis said, man; farewell.
__label__Cleopatra In praising Antony, I dispraised Caesar.
__label__Cleopatra Where art thou, death?
Come hither, come! come, come, queen
Worthy babes beggars!
__label__QueenMargaret How fares gracious lord?
__label__QueenMargaret Ay, usest forswear thyself:
'Twas sin before, 'tis charity.
What, wilt not? Where devil's butcher,
Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, art thou?
Thou art here: murder alms-deed;
Petitioners blood ne'er put'st back.
__label__Antony By sea, sea.
__label__Cleopatra There's gold thee.
Thou sharpness ill:
I employ thee again; I find thee
Most fit business: thee ready;
Our letters prepared.
__label__Antony How intend you, practised?
__label__Antony Caesar, lord?
__label__QueenMargaret Stay, Edward.
__label__Antony Good night, sir. My Octavia,
Read blemishes world's report:
I kept square; come
Shall rule. Good night, dear lady.
Good night, sir.
__label__Cleopatra I dream'd Emperor Antony:
O, sleep, I see
But man!
__label__Antony The queen shall courtesy, she
Will yield up.
__label__QueenMargaret Why, concerns freedom unto me?
__label__Cleopatra That's good: like long.
__label__Antony She cunning past man's thought.
__label__Cleopatra I'll set bourn far beloved.
__label__QueenMargaret Believe me, lords, flying brook,
I saw better sport seven years' day:
Yet, leave, wind high;
And, one, old Joan gone out.
__label__Cleopatra Nay, hear them, Antony:
Fulvia perchance angry; or, knows
If scarce-bearded Caesar sent
His powerful mandate you, 'Do this, this;
Take kingdom, enfranchise that;
Perform 't, damn thee.'
__label__QueenMargaret How fares lord? Help, lords! king dead.
__label__Antony My Egypt, Caesar,
What was't you?
__label__Antony Fall tear, I say; rates
All won lost: kiss;
Even repays me. We sent schoolmaster;
Is come back? Love, I lead.
Some wine, there, viands! Fortune knows
We scorn offers blows.
__label__Antony Make offended
In distrust.
__label__QueenMargaret Heavens grant Warwick's words bewitch not!
__label__Cleopatra Ay, ay; farewell.
__label__Antony Peace!
Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
But Antony's hath triumph'd itself.
__label__Antony How now, lady!
__label__Cleopatra O, pardon!
__label__Antony You'll heat blood: more.
__label__Cleopatra What I do, I not?
__label__Antony Forbear me.
[Exit Second Messenger]
There's great spirit gone! Thus I desire it:
What contempt doth hurl us,
We wish again; present pleasure,
By revolution lowering, become
The opposite itself: she's good, gone;
The hand pluck shoved on.
I enchanting queen break off:
Ten thousand harms, ills I know,
My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
__label__QueenMargaret Ah, father resolved!
__label__Antony Sir,
He fell ere admitted: then
Three kings I newly feasted, want
Of I i' morning: day
I told myself; much
As ask'd pardon. Let fellow
Be strife; contend,
Out question wipe him.
__label__QueenMargaret If ancient sorrow reverend,
Give benefit seniory,
And woes frown upper hand.
If sorrow admit society,
[Sitting them]
Tell o'er woes viewing mine:
I Edward, till Richard kill'd him;
I Harry, till Richard kill'd him:
Thou hadst Edward, till Richard kill'd him;
Thou hadst Richard, till Richard killed him;
__label__Antony Nay, press me; stand far off.
__label__Antony So noble Caesar.
__label__Antony Would scars prevail'd
To fight land!
__label__QueenMargaret Wilt accept ransom? yea, no.
__label__QueenMargaret I thee not.
__label__Antony Our overplus shipping burn;
And, rest full-mann'd, head Actium
Beat approaching Caesar. But fail,
We do't land.
[Enter Messenger]
Thy business?
__label__Antony So fame.
Would spoke together! Haste it:
Yet, ere arms, dispatch we
The business talk'd of.
__label__Antony Where lies he?
__label__Cleopatra Have yet?
__label__Antony Of colour too.
__label__QueenMargaret And leave thee? stay, dog, shalt hear me.
If heaven grievous plague store
Exceeding I wish thee,
O, till sins ripe,
And hurl indignation
On thee, troubler poor world's peace!
The worm conscience begnaw soul!
Thy friends suspect traitors livest,
And deep traitors dearest friends!
No sleep close deadly eye thine,
Unless whilst tormenting dream
Affrights thee hell ugly devils!
Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
Thou wast seal'd nativity
The slave nature son hell!
Thou slander mother's heavy womb!
Thou loathed issue father's loins!
Thou rag honour! detested--
__label__QueenMargaret I call'd thee vain flourish fortune;
I call'd thee poor shadow, painted queen;
The presentation I was;
The flattering index direful pageant;
One heaved a-high, hurl'd below;
A mother mock'd sweet babes;
A dream wert, breath, bubble,
A sign dignity, garish flag,
To aim dangerous shot,
A queen jest, fill scene.
Where husband now? brothers?
Where children? dost thou, joy?
Who sues thee cries 'God save queen'?
Where bending peers flatter'd thee?
Where thronging troops follow'd thee?
Decline this, art:
For happy wife, distressed widow;
For joyful mother, wails name;
For queen, caitiff crown'd care;
For sued to, humbly sues;
For scorn'd me, scorn'd me;
For fear'd all, fearing one;
For commanding all, obey'd none.
Thus hath course justice wheel'd about,
And left thee prey time;
Having thought wert,
To torture thee more, art.
Thou didst usurp place, dost not
Usurp proportion sorrow?
Now proud neck bears half burthen'd yoke;
From I slip weary neck,
And leave burthen thee.
Farewell, York's wife, queen sad mischance:
These English woes smile France.
__label__Antony They so.
__label__QueenMargaret A little joy enjoys queen thereof;
For I she, altogether joyless.
I longer hold patient.
[Advancing]
Hear me, wrangling pirates, fall out
In sharing pill'd me!
Which trembles looks me?
If not, that, I queen, bow like subjects,
Yet that, deposed, quake like rebels?
O gentle villain, turn away!
__label__Antony I they'ld fight i' fire i' air;
We'ld fight too. But is; foot
Upon hills adjoining city
Shall stay us: order sea given;
They forth haven [--]
Where appointment best discover,
And look endeavour.
__label__Cleopatra Dolabella!
__label__Cleopatra Sir, I eat meat, I'll drink, sir;
If idle talk necessary,
I'll sleep neither: mortal house I'll ruin,
Do Caesar can. Know, sir, I
Will wait pinion'd master's court;
Nor chastised sober eye
Of dull Octavia. Shall hoist up
And shouting varletry
Of censuring Rome? Rather ditch Egypt
Be gentle grave unto me! Nilus' mud
Lay stark naked, water-flies
Blow abhorring! make
My country's high pyramides gibbet,
And hang chains!
__label__Antony Grates me: sum.
__label__QueenMargaret I reason king years
Should protected like child.
God King Henry govern England's realm.
Give staff, sir, king realm.
__label__QueenMargaret So sadly troublous world,
To meet joy sweet Jerusalem.
__label__Cleopatra Farewell, thanks.
[Exit DOLABELLA]
Now, Iras, think'st thou?
Thou, Egyptian puppet, shalt shown
In Rome, I. mechanic slaves
With greasy aprons, rules, hammers, shall
Uplift view; thick breaths,
Rank gross diet, shall enclouded,
And forced drink vapour.
__label__QueenMargaret I best leave him, hear.
__label__QueenMargaret And heart thee.
__label__Antony To flatter Caesar, mingle eyes
With ties points?
__label__QueenMargaret Thou hast spoke already: thee gone.
__label__Cleopatra Why lord enraged love?
__label__Cleopatra Sooth, la, I'll help: be.
__label__QueenMargaret Ay, wast born plague men.
__label__QueenMargaret Which God revenge!
__label__QueenMargaret Then you, belike, suspect noblemen
As guilty Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
__label__Cleopatra O, I didst,
So half Egypt submerged made
A cistern scaled snakes! Go, thee hence:
Hadst Narcissus face, me
Thou wouldst appear ugly. He married?
__label__QueenMargaret Because king, forsooth, so.
__label__Cleopatra That Herod's head
I'll have: how, Antony gone
Through I command it? Come near.
__label__Antony Can person? 'tis impossible;
Strange power be. Canidius,
Our nineteen legions shalt hold land,
And thousand horse. We'll ship:
Away, Thetis!
[Enter Soldier]
How now, worthy soldier?
__label__QueenMargaret Mount you, lord; Berwick post amain:
Edward Richard, like brace greyhounds
Having fearful flying hare sight,
With fiery eyes sparkling wrath,
And bloody steel grasp'd ireful hands,
Are backs; amain.
__label__Cleopatra Was here?
__label__Cleopatra Mine ear pluck thence.
__label__Antony O, pardon me, bleeding piece earth,
That I meek gentle butchers!
Thou art ruins noblest man
That lived tide times.
Woe hand shed costly blood!
Over wounds I prophesy,--
Which, like dumb mouths, ope ruby lips,
To beg voice utterance tongue--
A curse shall light limbs men;
Domestic fury fierce civil strife
Shall cumber parts Italy;
Blood destruction shall use
And dreadful objects familiar
That mothers shall smile behold
Their infants quarter'd hands war;
All pity choked custom fell deeds:
And Caesar's spirit, ranging revenge,
With Ate come hot hell,
Shall confines monarch's voice
Cry 'Havoc,' slip dogs war;
That foul deed shall smell earth
With carrion men, groaning burial.
[Enter Servant]
You serve Octavius Caesar, not?
__label__Antony The gods best know,--
__label__Antony 'Tis so. And tears wet.
__label__Antony You gentle Romans,--
__label__Cleopatra Be known, we, greatest, misthought
For things do; and, fall,
We answer others' merits name,
Are pitied.
__label__Cleopatra Bear'st face mind? is't long round?
__label__Antony Is strange, Canidius,
That Tarentum Brundusium
He quickly cut Ionian sea,
And Toryne? You heard on't, sweet?
__label__QueenMargaret That thyself: I presume
To send peevish tokens king.
__label__QueenMargaret Welcome, lord, brave town York.
Yonder's head arch-enemy
That sought encompass'd crown:
Doth object cheer heart, lord?
__label__Cleopatra Celerity admired
Than negligent.
__label__Antony When I thee free, sworest then
To I bade thee? Do once;
Or precedent services all
But accidents unpurposed. Draw, come.
__label__QueenMargaret Ay, good lord, leave fortune.
__label__Antony Caesar?
__label__Antony Vanish, I shall thee deserving,
And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let thee,
And hoist thee shouting plebeians:
Follow chariot, like greatest spot
Of sex; monster-like, shown
For poor'st diminutives, doits; let
Patient Octavia plough visage up
With prepared nails.
[Exit CLEOPATRA]
'Tis thou'rt gone,
If live; better 'twere
Thou fell'st fury, death
Might prevented many. Eros, ho!
The shirt Nessus me: teach me,
Alcides, ancestor, rage:
Let lodge Lichas horns o' moon;
And hands, grasp'd heaviest club,
Subdue worthiest self. The witch shall die:
To young Roman boy hath sold me, I fall
Under plot; dies for't. Eros, ho!
__label__Antony Get thee gone:
Say Ventidius I speak him:
[Exit Soothsayer]
He shall Parthia. Be art hap,
He hath spoken true: dice obey him;
And sports better cunning faints
Under chance: draw lots, speeds;
His cocks win battle mine,
When nought; quails ever
Beat mine, inhoop'd, odds. I Egypt:
And I marriage peace,
I' east pleasure lies.
[Enter VENTIDIUS]
O, come, Ventidius,
You Parthia: commission's ready;
